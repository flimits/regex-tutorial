Specia thanks to a couple of sites that really helped me understand more about them:

RegexBuddy  https://www.regular-expressions.info/charclass.html
Ocpsoft  https://www.ocpsoft.org/tutorials/regular-expressions/or-in-regex/

And of course, Daniel Shiffman with, The Coding Train on YouTube.com (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DG3kCDx53c)
